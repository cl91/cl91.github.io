	  Oscillons are spatially stationary, quasi-periodic solutions
	  of nonlinear field theories. (<em>Informal version: oscillons
	    are what would happen if a stone was thrown into a pond and,
	    rather than creating ripples, the water bounced up and down
	    at the point of impact – this doesn’t (usually!) happen with
	    water, but is possible in systems where the “restoring force”
	    does not increase continuously with displacement.</em>)
	  Oscillons can be seen in a wide range of settings, including
	  granular systems, low temperature condensates, and in models
	  of the very early universe.
	</p>

	  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07228" target="_blank">
	    ArXiv:1612.07228</a> (Liu and Easther) introduces a new class
	  of oscillons which can have an off-centre spatial profile and
	  an envelope whose overall shape evolves with time. These oscillons
	  are exact solutions of the sine-Gordon potential in 1 dimension
	  and have two distinct frequency parameters, ω<sub>1</sub> and
	  ω<sub>2</sub>, both of which must be less than one; see equations
	  4-7 of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07228"
		    target="_blank">ArXiv:1612.07228</a>. In the limit where
	  one frequency is exactly unity the solution reduces to the
	  well-known “breather”, shown below:

	<h2>Pulsating Oscillons</h2>
	<p>
	  When both frequencies are close to unity the envelope pulsates
	  slowly with time while the profile is peaked at the centre:

	</div>

	<h2>Double-peak Breathers</h2>
	<p>
	  For a wide range of parameters these oscillons have a complex
	  “double peak” structure, where the peak field amplitude occurs
	  away from the oscillon centre, overlaid with a complex pulsating
	  envelope:

	  </video>
	</div>

	<h2>Large-amplitude Limit</h2>
	<p>
	  When one of the frequencies approaches zero we see a fast,
	  small amplitude oscillation, superimposed on a much slower,
	  large amplitude variation.

	  The above solutions are all plotted from an exact, analytic
	  solution to the sine-Gordon equation, a 1+1 dimensional PDE.
	  (Equations 4-7 of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07228" target="_blank">
	    ArXiv:1612.07228</a>); the full solution space contains a
	  very rich set of possible behaviours.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Solutions with similar properties have previously been seen
	  in variety of settings but their properties had never been
	  understood or analysed in any detail. We use the exact 1-D
	  solution to initialise a numerical solver (with an assumption
	  of rotational symmetry in more than one dimension) for a range
	  of potentials, allowing us to demonstrate that qualitatively
	  similar solutions can be supported by a wide range of potentials.
	</p>

	<p>
	  We are particularly interested in the oscillons seen in
	  simulations of the dynamics following
	  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.3335" target="_blank">
	    monodromy inflation</a>, an interesting class of
	  string-motivated cosmological models. In these scenarios
	  the resonant growth of perturbations renders the universe
	  very inhomogeneous on microscopically small scales during
	  an epoch roughly 10<sup>-33</sup> seconds after the Big
	  Bang. A full 3D simulation of this oscillon-dominated phase
	  is shown below; these results are described in more detail
	  in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.3335" target="_blank">
	    ArXiv:1106.3335</a>. The simulations begin with an
	  initially homogeneous, oscillating inflaton condensate which
	  undergoes parametric resonance, rendering the universe highly
	  inhomogeneous, followed by oscillon formation (the point at
	  which the video below begins.) The oscillons are often initially
	  highly asymmetric but relax to approximately spherical
	  configurations. Once the oscillon dominated phase is
	  well-established the mixture of short- and long period
	  oscillations are clearly visible; the latter are most obvious
	  in the oscillons which intersect the sides of the box. (The
	  orange contours show regions in which local density is six
	  times greater than the average density.)
